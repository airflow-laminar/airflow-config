Note that Airflow simply looks at the latest execution_date and adds the schedule_interval to determine the next execution_date. It is also very important to note that different tasks’ dependencies need to line up in time. If task A depends on task B and their start_date are offset in a way that their execution_date don’t line up, A’s dependencies will never be met. If you are looking to delay a task, for example running a daily task at 2AM, look into the TimeSensor and TimeDeltaSensor. We advise against using dynamic start_date and recommend using fixed ones.

This is useful when you have multiple dag run instances and desire to have all upstream tasks to complete for all runs before each dag can continue processing downstream tasks. When set to upstream the effective weight is the aggregate sum of all upstream ancestors. This is the opposite where downstream tasks have higher weight and will be scheduled more aggressively when using positive weight values. This is useful when you have multiple dag run instances and prefer to have each dag complete before starting upstream tasks of other dags. When set to absolute, the effective weight is the exact priority_weight specified without additional weighting. You may want to do this when you know exactly what priority weight each task should have. Additionally, when set to absolute, there is bonus effect of significantly speeding up the task creation process as for very large DAGs.

Context contains references to related objects to the task instance and is documented under the macros section of the API.

Explicitly it is NOT called if a task is not started to be executed because of a preceding branching decision in the DAG or a trigger rule which causes execution to skip so that the task execution is never scheduled.

If False, then an exception will be raised if the operator is badly used (e.g. nested within another one). In future releases of Airflow this parameter will be removed and an exception will always be thrown when operators are nested within each other (default is True).
